public : static page for html,images,videos
src: dynamic page for css,js,ts, etc.
app.js is our site for our understanding...
created a root id in html ---->  linked with index.js in src ----->this index.js activates the app.js----->activated app.js-------->>which is our web page.
In react there are two components 1.class based component 2.funciton based component.the funciton based component is in trend whcih is what used in (app.js)----->fucn App()
and inside funn App() we write the code in jsx(java script extension) which we return in that particular function---->jsx is nothing but in simple terms it's an html format code.
I wanna say that html code is written in format of java script which we call is jsx(javascript extension).we can call as jsx is combination of html+js.where js is written in curly brackets in jsx.
***  in setting --> emmet --> add in included languages to --> javascript to javascriptreact.
In return block there should be only one return statement like only 1-div block, if u want more than one div blocks then you have to write whole code in paranthesis like(<> content </>)the code/html should be written between these.
there is no meaning called reload but in html css js reload happens for evry page.  
the href should be like this ---->> href="/" and closing tags should be present. eg: hr tags
I have created a folder called components where it have actual code whcih we export(navbar.js) and import from other folder(app.js).
you made a component and you want to pass somethings in it, you say that this is the components with some variables in it which i will tell what it will be this is called props
NavBar.propTypes={title:PropTypes.string, about: PropTypes.string} ------> this means the title and about should be string not other datatypes
title:PropTypes.string.isRequired --------> if the input is not given then error occurs
useState is a hook in react which store the current state and update state of present variable.
for eg:
        const [text,setText]=useState('Enter text here');--------->here the text is updated using setText funciton. and text is current text.to clear the default value of text is"enter text here".f
to use image in jsx we should not direcly write path of image instead ------>import img from './img.jpg' we have to import and assing on one variable and use like src={img}.
if u want ot change the styel of particular element ---> style={{ height: '300px' }}
import { useState } from "react" this is how we import useState.
Comments: Use {/* comment */} syntax for comments inside JSX.
